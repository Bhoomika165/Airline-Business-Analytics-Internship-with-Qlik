# Exploring Insights From Synthetic Airline Data Analysis With Qlik

In this Business Analytics Internship, I have learned how to make visualizations using the "Qlik" platform for the Airline dataset and created dashboards and Storytelling for the data provided in the dataset.

## Project Description: 
   In today's dynamic aviation industry, understanding the intricacies of airline operations is paramount for enhancing efficiency, optimizing services, and ensuring passenger satisfaction. Exploring Insights From Synthetic Airline Data Analysis With Qlik comprehensively examines diverse parameters within the airline domain. This analysis is facilitated by a rich dataset encompassing various facets of airline operations globally. 
   The dataset, meticulously curated for comprehensive analysis, contains an array of crucial fields including Passenger ID, First Name, Last Name, Gender, Age, Nationality, Airport Name, Airport Country Code, Country Name, Airport Continent, Continents, Departure Date, Arrival Airport, Pilot Name, and Flight Status. Each column contributes to a holistic understanding of passenger demographics, travel specifics, flight routes, crew details, and real-time flight statuses.
